# go-stm: Software Transactional Memory in Go
// Name Here

## Summary
I would like to implement a software transactional memory package in the Go programming language and benchmark its performance under various workloads.

## Background
// TODO

## The Challenge
// TODO

## Goals and Deliverables
My goal is to build a SMT Go package with an API similar to Haskell's Control.Concurrent.STM.

## Platform Choice
Development will be on my own laptop, which is a MacBook Pro with 2.3 GHz Quad-Core Intel i5 processor and 8GB 2133MHz DDR3 memory.  
Benchmark will be on the GHC machines which have more cores to experiment with.

## Schedule
