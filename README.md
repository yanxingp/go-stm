# **go-stm: Software Transactionl Memory in Go**
## CMU 15-618 S20 course project.

Implementation based on [Transactional Locking II](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/kuznetso/INF346-2015/papers/tl2.pdf) algorithm.

Testing and benchmark code are inspired by [decellion's implementation](https://github.com/decillion/go-stm). Thank you!
